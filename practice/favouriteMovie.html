    <summary>
        Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancchoddas "Rancho" Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir
        Khan) are three engineering students who share a room in a hostel at the Imperial College of Engineering, one of
        the best colleges in India. While Farhan and Raju are average students from modest backgrounds, Rancho is from a
        rich family. Farhan wants to become a wildlife photographer, but has joined engineering college to fulfil his
        father's wish. Raju on the other hand wants to uplift his family fortunes. Rancho is a wealthy genius who
        studies for the sheer joy of it. However, Rancho's passion is for knowledge and taking apart and building
        machines rather than the conventional obsession of the other students with exam ranks. With his different
        approach Rancho incurs the wrath of dean of college, Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) (Boman Irani). Rancho
        irritates his lecturers by giving creative and unorthodox answers, and confronts ViruS after fellow student Joy
        Lobo hangs himself in his dormitory room. Joy had requested an extension on his major project on compassionate
        groundshis father had suffered a strokebut ViruS refused, saying that he himself was completely unmoved by his
        own son's accidental death after being hit by a train. Rancho denounces the rat race, dog-eat-dog, mindless rote
        learning mentality of the institution, blaming it for Lobo's death.
        Threatened by Rancho's talent and free spirit, ViruS labels him an "idiot" and attempts on a number of occasions
        to destroy his friendship with Farhan and Raju, warning them and their parents to steer clear of Rancho. In
        contrast, ViruS model student is Chatur Ramalingam or "Silencer", (Omi Vaidya) who sees a high rank at the
        prestigious college as his ticket to higher social status, corporate power, and therefore wealth. Chatur
        conforms to the expectations of the system. Rancho humiliates Chatur, who is awarded the honour of making a
        speech at an award ceremony, by substituting obscenities into the text, which has been written by the librarian.
        As expected, Chatur mindlessly memorises the speech, without noticing that anything is amiss, partly aided by
        his lack of knowledge on Hindi. His speech becomes the laughing stock of the audience, infuriating the
        authorities in the process.
        Meanwhile, Rancho also falls in love with ViruS' medical student daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor) when he, Raju and
        Farhan crash her sister's wedding banquet in order to get a free meal, in the process further infuriating ViruS.
        Meanwhile, the three students continue to anger ViruS, although Rancho continues to come first in every exam,
        while Chatur is always second, and Farhan and Raju are inevitably in the last two positions. The tensions come
        to a head when the three friends, who are already drunk, break into ViruS's house at night to allow Rancho to
        propose to Pia, and then urinate on a door inside the compound before running away when ViruS senses intruders.
        The next day, ViruS threatens to expel Raju lest he talks on the other two. Unable to choose between betraying
        his friend or letting down his family, Raju jumps out of the 3rd floor window and lands on a courtyard, but
        after extensive care from Pia and his roommates, awakes from a coma.
        The experience has changed Farhan and Raju, and they adopt Rancho's outlook. Farhan decides to pursue his love
        of photography, while Raju takes an unexpected approach for an interview for a corporate job. He attends in
        plaster and a wheelchair and gives a series of non-conformal and frank answers. However, ViruS is unsympathetic
        and vows to make the final exam as hard as possible so that Raju is unable to graduate. Pia hears him and
        angrily confronts him, and when ViruS gives the same ruthless reply he gives to his students, she denounces him
        in the same way that Rancho did over the suicide of Lobo. Pia reveals that Viru's son and her brother was not
        killed in an accident but committed suicide in front of a train and left a letter because ViruS had forced him
        to pursue a career in engineering over his love for literature; ViruS always mentioned that he unsympathetically
        failed his son on the ICE entrance exams over and over to every new intake of ICE students. After this, Pia
        walks out on the family home, and takes ViruS's spare keys with her. She tells Rancho of the exam, and he and
        Farhan break into ViruS's office and steals the exam and give it to Raju, who with his new-found attitude, is
        unconcerned with the prospect of failing, and refuses to cheat and throws the paper away. However, ViruS catches
        the trio and expels them on the spot. However, they earn a reprieve when Viru's pregnant elder daughter Mona
        (Mona Singh) goes into labour at the same time. A heavy storm cuts all power and traffic, and Pia is still in
        self-imposed exile, so she instructs Rancho to deliver the baby in the college common room via VOIP, after
        Rancho restores power using car batteries and a power inverter that Rancho had dreamed up and ViruS had mocked.
        Rancho then delivers the baby with the help of a cobbled-together Vacuum extractor.
        After the baby is apparently stillborn, Rancho resuscitates it. ViruS reconciles with Rancho and his friends and
        allows them to take their final exams and they graduate. Rancho comes first and is awarded ViruS's pen, which
        the professor had been keeping for decades before finding a brilliant enough student to gift it to.
        Their story is framed as intermittent flashbacks from the present day, ten years after Chatur vowed revenge on
        Rancho for embarrassing him at the speech night and promised to become more successful than Rancho a decade
        later. Having lost contact with Rancho, who disappeared during the graduation party and went into seclusion,
        Raju and Farhan begin a journey to find him. They are joined by Chatur, now a wealthy and successful
        businessman, who joins them, brazenly confident that he has surpassed Rancho. Chatur is also looking to seal a
        deal with a famous scientist and prospective business associate named Phunsukh Wangdu. Chatur sees Wangdu, who
        has hundreds of patents, as his ticket to further social prestige. When they find Rancho's house, they walk into
        his father's funeral, and find a completely different Rancho Jaaved Jaffrey. After accusing the new man of
        stealing their friend's identity and profiting from his intellect, the host pulls a gun on them, but Farhan and
        Raju turn the tables by seizing the father's ashes and threatening to flush them down the toilet. The
        householder capitulates and says that their friend was a destitute servant boy who loved learning, while he, the
        real Rancho, was a lazy wealthy child who disliked study, so the family agreed to let the servant boy study in
        Rancho's place instead of labouring. In return, the real Rancho would pocket the qualifications and the benefits
        thereof, while the impersonator would sever all contact with the world and start a new life. The real Rancho
        reveals that his impersonator is now a schoolteacher in Ladakh.
        Raju and Farhan then find Pia, and take her from her wedding day to Suhas by performing the same tricks with his
        material possessions, and having Raju turn up to the ceremony disguised as the groom and eloping with Pia in
        public. When they arrive in Ladakh, they see a group of enthusiastic Ladakhi children who are motivated by love
        of knowledge. Pia and the fake Rancho rekindle their love, while Chatur mocks and abuses Rancho the
        schoolteacher before walking away. When his friends ask what his real name is, he reveals that it Phunsukh
        Wangdu and phones Chatur, who has turned his back, to turn around and meet his prospective business partner.
        Chatur is horrified and falls to his knees, accepts his defeat and continues to plead his case with Phunsukh to
        establish the business relationship he was after.

        Favourite quotes:
        <ul>
            <li>Ever since we were young, we believed that life was a race. If we didn’t run fast enough, we would be
                trampled and overtaken. Man, even to be born, we had to race 300 million sperm.– Farhan, ‘3 Idiots’.
            </li>
            <li>A cuckoo bird never makes its own nest. She lays eggs on other birds nests. And when her babies come to
                the world, what do they do first? They kick out the other eggs from the nest. Competition over. Their
                life begins with murder. That’s nature. Compete. Or die.– Virus, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Remember – Life is a race. If you don’t run fast enough, someone will overtake you and move faster.–
                Virus, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Machine Class Professor: Why are you back?
                Rancho: Sir, I forgot to take something…
                Machine Class Professor: What?
                Rancho: Instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information; that are
                illustrated, non-illustrated, hardbound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with foreword, introduction,
                table of contents, index; that are indented for the enlightenment, understanding, enrichment,
                enhancement and education of the human brain through sensory route of vision – sometimes touch.
                Machine Class Professor: [confused] What are you trying to say?
                Rancho: Books sir! I forgot to take my books.
                Machine Class Professor: Couldn’t you just say that simply?
                Rancho: I tried sometime before, but you didn’t like it the simple way, Sir. – ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>There was knowledge everywhere. Go get it from anywhere you can.– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Mr. Lobo, my son died falling off of a train on a Sunday afternoon. On Monday morning, Viru
                Shastrabhuddhe gave a lecture here. So don’t tell me that nonsense. I can only give you sympathy. Not an
                extension.– Virus, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Rancho: That day I understood that this heart scares easily. You have to trick it, however big the
                problem is. Tell your heart, ‘aal izz well, aal izz well.’</li>
            Raju: Does that solve the problem?
            Rancho: No, but you gain courage to face it. –‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Give me some sunshine,
                Give me some rain,
                Give me another chance,
                I wanna grow up once again… – Joy Lobo, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Sir! What Number 1, sir? Here we don’t talk about new ideas. Or about new inventions! We only talk about
                getting good grades, or a good job in the USA. We don’t gain any knowledge here, Sir. They only teach us
                how to bring back good grades here.– Rancho,‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>And this is a college, not a pressure cooker! The lion in a circus learns that he needs to sit on the
                chair if his owner has a whip in his hand. But that lion is called well-trained, not well-educated.–
                Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Never study to be successful, study for self efficiency. Don’t run behind success. Follow behind
                excellence, success will come all way behind you.– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>We learned something about human behavior that day. If your friend fails, you feel bad. But if your
                friend comes in first, you feel worse.– Farhan, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Today my respect for that idiot shot up. Most of us went to college just for a degree. No degree meant
                no plum job, no pretty wife, no credit card, no social status. But none of this mattered to him, he was
                in college for the joy of learning, he never cared if he was first or last.– Farhan, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li> was the first man to step on the moon? Neil Armstrong obviously. We all know that, but who was the
                second man? Don’t waste your time. It’s not important. Nobody ever remembers the man who came in
                second.– Virus, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Do you know why I come first? Why? Because I’m in love with machines. Engineering is my passion!–
                Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Dude, quit engineering and become a wildlife photographer! Do something that you have talent for. If
                Lata Mangeshkar’s (singer) father told her to become a fast bowler. Or if Sachin Tendulkar’s (Cricketer)
                father told him to be a singer. Imagine where they’d be today. Do you understand what I’m saying? Idiot.
                He loves animals but he’s marrying machines!– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Dude, if you fear the future so much, how can you live? And how can you focus on today? I’ve got strange
                friends, Man. One of them is living in fear, and the other one is not living at all!– Rancho, ‘3
                Idiots’.</li>
            <li>But you be whatever your heart tells you to. And if he scares you too much. Keep a hand over your heart
                and say, “AAL IZZ WELL!– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Whatever you enjoy doing, make that your profession. Then work won’t seem to be work, but a game.–
                Farhan quote Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>If I become a photographer? I’ll just earn less, right? My home will be small, my car will be small.
                But, dad, I will be happy! I will be really happy. Whatever I do, I’ll be doing it from my heart.–
                Farhan, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Sir, I have learnt to stand up on my feet after having broken both my legs. This attitude has come with
                great difficulty. No sir, I can’t. You may keep your job, and let me keep my attitude.– Raju, ‘3
                Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Everyone turns into a yes-man to get the job”. – Recruiter, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>If I pass, it’ll be because of my own ability. Otherwise it’s okay if I fail.– Raju, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>You’ve got a solid kick. Are you going to be a footballer or what? Become. Become whatever your heart
                wants.– Virus, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Children, achieve excellence. Because then success will chase you!– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Pursue excellence, and success will follow, pants down.– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
            <li>These engineers are very smart sir, they didn’t invent a machine which can measure the pressure on the
                brain. If they had, we would have come to know that this was not a suicide but a Murder.–Rancho, ‘3
                Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Rancho was right when he said “Pursue excellence, and success will follow, pants down!– Farhan, ‘3
                Idiots’.</li>
            <li>That day we learned, when your friend flunks, you feel bad, when he tops, you feel worse.– Farhan, ‘3
                Idiots’.</li>
            <li>Instruments that record analyse summarize organize debate and explain information which are illustrative
                non-illustrative hardbound paperback jacketed non-jacketed with forward introduction, table of contents,
                index that are intended for the enlightenment, understanding enrichment enhancement and education of the
                human brain through sensory root of vision… Sometimes touch– Rancho, ‘3 Idiots’.</li>
